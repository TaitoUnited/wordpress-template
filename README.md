[//]: # (TEMPLATE NOTE START)

Wordpress-template is a project template for WordPress sites. Create a new project from this template by running `taito project create: wordpress-template`.

TIP: A static site generator combined with a CMS system, git repository, and some additional services provides a more secure and care-free alternative for WordPress sites. It also provides a sensible way to do version control and automatic migrations between environments. However, such implementation doesn't offer as much plug-and-play functionality as WordPress does. See the [website-template](https://github.com/TaitoUnited/website-template) as an example.
